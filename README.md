## Explanation of tasks and program

#### Exception task

```
        To demonstrate acquired knowledge, i created spring app, where the scenario is as follows:
        We have a POJO Car, which consists of brand, model and kilometers driven so far.
        We have a POJO SuperCar, which consists of Car and horsepower.
        We have a POJO IpClass that contains only ip string.

        Demonstration scenarios:
        1. For unchecked exception (which occurs inside the code/program) I will create a new instance of Car with negative kilometers driven and supercar with too much horsepower.
        2. For checked exception (which occurs outside the code/program) I will request data from external api and then validate it. In this case i validate ip sytnax from external api with regex.

        Pojos can be found in package models, exceptions in exceptions and main program/class is in package exception_assignment, which is then called in main to start.
```
